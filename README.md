Octocatsay
==========

You know [cowsay](http://www.nog.net/~tony/warez/cowsay.shtml), right? Well...

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/cobyism/octocatsay.git
$ cd octocatsay
$ ./octocatsay 'BOOYAH!'

           MMM.           .MMM           
           MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

Clearly this is an (inadequate) rip-off of [Cowsay](http://www.nog.net/~tony/warez/cowsay.shtml) by [Tony Monroe](http://www.nog.net/~tony/).

Do what you like with this, however remember that the Octocat is a trademark owned by [GitHub](https://github.com/). See their [Octocat usage F.A.Q.](http://octodex.github.com/faq.html) for what you can and can't do. 

## TODO

- Make it so that it's something you can actually install on your system, rather than just a script you run.
- Create an `octocathink` version like `cowthink`.
- Do a better job on the ASCII, especially the negative space around the eyes.
- Maybe change it from Perl to being just straight Bash. Less dependancy? (Does it really matter?)
